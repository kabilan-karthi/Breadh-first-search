# Breadh-first-search
The provided program is an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (in this case, node 'A'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
