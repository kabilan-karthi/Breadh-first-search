# Breadh-first-search
The provided program is an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (in this case, node 'A'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
Key Concepts
Graph Traversal: The process of visiting, checking, and/or updating each node in a graph data structure.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that starts from a selected node and explores all neighbors at the current depth level before moving to the nodes at the next depth level.
Queue: A First In First Out (FIFO) data structure used in BFS to keep track of the nodes that are to be explored.
Visited List: A list to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited during the traversal to prevent processing a node more than once.
How It Works
The bfs function is defined with parameters for the visited list, the graph to be traversed, and the starting node.
The starting node is marked as visited by appending it to the visited list and also added to the queue.
The function enters a loop that continues as long as there are nodes in the queue.
In each iteration of the loop, the node at the front of the queue is taken out and its neighbors are explored. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited, it is marked as visited and added to the queue.
This process continues until the queue is empty, meaning all nodes reachable from the starting node have been explored.
Usage
This BFS program can be used in a variety of applications such as:

Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
Crawling web pages starting from a root page.
Serializing a binary tree into a level-order traversal, etc.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) Program

This program is an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal. It is written in Python and can be used to explore the nodes of a graph starting from a specified root node.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

How to Run:

Define your graph as a dictionary where each key-value pair corresponds to a node and its list of neighbors, respectively.
Initialize an empty list visited to keep track of visited nodes.
Initialize an empty list queue to be used by the BFS algorithm.
Call the bfs function with your graph and starting node.
